# File Implementation Matrix - Decentralized Medical Records System

## Overview

This matrix provides a comprehensive view of every file in the project, mapping implementation status, dependencies, and integration points. Use this as a reference for understanding component interconnections and tracking development progress at the file level.

## Legend

### Implementation Status
- ✅ **Complete** - File exists and fully implemented
- 🔄 **In Progress** - Currently being developed
- 📝 **Needs Modification** - File exists but requires changes
- 🆕 **Needs Creation** - File doesn't exist, needs to be created
- ❌ **Blocked** - Cannot proceed due to dependencies

### Priority Levels
- 🔴 **Critical** - Must be completed first (blocking others)
- 🟡 **High** - Important for core functionality
- 🟢 **Medium** - Supporting functionality
- ⚪ **Low** - Nice to have, not essential

### Testing Status
- ✅ **Tested** - Has comprehensive tests
- 🧪 **Partial** - Some tests exist
- ❌ **Untested** - No tests yet

## Dependency Analysis

### Critical Path Files (Must Complete First)
1. **AccessControl.sol** → Blocks all other contracts
2. **EncryptionService.ts** → Blocks IPFS and record handling
3. **ContractService.ts** → Blocks all frontend functionality
4. **Patient Dashboard** → Core user experience

### High-Impact Files (Affect Multiple Components)
- **MedicalRecords.sol** → Used by all portals
- **IPFSService.ts** → Required for all file operations
- **Type definitions** → Required for TypeScript compilation

### Parallel Development Opportunities
- **Specialist Portal** can be developed alongside **Patient Portal**
- **Documentation** can be created alongside component development
- **Hospital Portal** has minimal dependencies after service layer

### Integration Bottlenecks
- **Smart Contract Deployment** → Required before frontend testing
- **Service Layer Completion** → Required before portal development
- **Testing Infrastructure** → Required before quality assurance

---

## File Change Tracking

### Recently Modified
- None (baseline established Aug 2, 2025)

### Next to be Modified
1. `contracts/AccessControl.sol` - Enhanced role management
2. `frontend/packages/nextjs/services/encryption/EncryptionService.ts` - New encryption service
3. `contracts/MedicalRecords.sol` - IPFS integration

### Pending Review
- None (no files ready for review yet)

### Ready for Testing
- None (no files completed yet)

## Quality Metrics by File Type

### Smart Contracts
- **Total Files:** 9 (3 core, 3 interfaces, 2 libraries, 1 test file group)
- **Completion:** 0%
- **Test Coverage Target:** 100% (critical security requirement)
- **Documentation Required:** Yes (all public functions)

### Frontend Services
- **Total Files:** 18 (6 encryption, 4 IPFS, 8 contracts)
- **Completion:** 0%
- **Test Coverage Target:** 90%
- **Documentation Required:** Yes (all public methods)

### UI Components
- **Total Files:** 36 (12 patient, 12 specialist, 12 hospital)
- **Completion:** 0%
- **Test Coverage Target:** 80%
- **Documentation Required:** Yes (component props and usage)

### Testing Files
- **Total Files:** 10 (6 unit tests, 4 integration tests)
- **Completion:** 0%
- **Coverage Target:** N/A (they provide coverage)
- **Documentation Required:** Yes (test scenarios and setup)

## Integration Points Matrix

### Service Integration Dependencies
```
EncryptionService → IPFSService → ContractService → UI Components
      ↓                ↓              ↓
Smart Contracts → Type Definitions → Testing
```

### Component Integration Flow
```
Dashboard → Records Management → Access Control
    ↓            ↓                    ↓
Navigation → File Operations → Permission Management
```

### Testing Integration Chain
```
Unit Tests → Integration Tests → E2E Tests → Quality Gates
```

---

## Notes

### Development Strategy
- **Bottom-up approach:** Start with smart contracts, build services, then UI
- **Incremental testing:** Test each layer before moving to the next
- **Parallel development:** Multiple developers can work on different portals simultaneously

### Risk Mitigation
- **Smart contract changes:** May require service layer updates
- **Type definition changes:** May require widespread updates
- **Service interface changes:** May require component updates

### Quality Assurance
- **Code reviews:** Required for all files before marking complete
- **Integration testing:** Required before marking components ready
- **Documentation:** Required before final deployment
