# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This project aims to create a decentralized medical records system that empowers patients with full sovereignty over their health data while enabling secure, permissioned access for private hospitals. Built on Avalanche's private network infrastructure, the system addresses the critical problem of medical record portability and patient data ownership in Bolivia and the broader LATAM region, where medical histories are currently fragmented and controlled by individual clinics.

The system will enable patients to encrypt and store their medical documents on IPFS, manage access permissions through smart contracts, and grant selective access to hospitals for risk assessment and policy underwriting processes.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Patient Data Sovereignty

**User Story:** As a patient, I want to own and control my complete medical history in a decentralized system, so that I can maintain sovereignty over my health data and share it selectively with authorized parties.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a patient creates an account THEN the system SHALL generate a unique wallet address for the patient
2. WHEN a patient uploads a medical document THEN the system SHALL encrypt the document client-side before storage
3. WHEN a patient views their dashboard THEN the system SHALL display all their medical records with metadata
4. IF a patient wants to delete a record THEN the system SHALL remove access permissions and mark the record as deleted
5. WHEN a patient logs in THEN the system SHALL authenticate them using their Web3 wallet

### Requirement 2: Secure Document Storage and Encryption

**User Story:** As a patient, I want my medical documents to be securely encrypted and stored in a decentralized manner, so that my sensitive health information remains private and tamper-proof.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a patient uploads a medical document THEN the system SHALL encrypt the document using ECIES before IPFS upload
2. WHEN a document is stored THEN the system SHALL generate and store the IPFS hash on the blockchain
3. WHEN encryption occurs THEN the system SHALL use the patient's private key for encryption operations
4. IF document upload fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and retry mechanisms
5. WHEN a document is retrieved THEN the system SHALL verify the integrity using blockchain-stored hashes

### Requirement 3: Granular Access Control and Permissions

**User Story:** As a patient, I want to grant specific permissions to hospitals to access selected medical records, so that I can control exactly what information is shared and with whom.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a patient grants access THEN the system SHALL create a smart contract permission entry for the specified clinic
2. WHEN setting permissions THEN the patient SHALL be able to specify which documents are accessible
3. WHEN permissions are granted THEN the system SHALL set expiration dates for access rights
4. IF a patient revokes access THEN the system SHALL immediately update the smart contract to deny further access
5. WHEN permissions are modified THEN the system SHALL log all changes with timestamps and involved parties

### Requirement 4: Specialist Medic Access Interface

**User Story:** As a specialist medic, I want to access patient medical records that have been explicitly shared with me, so that I can provide informed medical care and make accurate diagnoses based on complete patient history.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a specialist medic logs in THEN the system SHALL display all records they have permission to access
2. WHEN a specialist medic requests access to a document THEN the system SHALL verify their permissions via smart contract
3. WHEN permissions are valid THEN the system SHALL decrypt and display the medical document
4. IF access is denied THEN the system SHALL provide clear feedback about permission status
5. WHEN a specialist medic views a document THEN the system SHALL log the access event for audit purposes

### Requirement 5: Private Network Infrastructure

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the system to operate on a private Avalanche network with permissioned node access, so that only authorized service providers can participate in the network.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the network is deployed THEN only contracted service providers SHALL have node access
2. WHEN a new node joins THEN the system SHALL verify the node's authorization credentials
3. WHEN smart contracts are deployed THEN they SHALL only be accessible within the private network
4. IF unauthorized access is attempted THEN the system SHALL reject the connection and log the attempt
5. WHEN network operations occur THEN the system SHALL maintain high availability and performance standards

### Requirement 6: User Interface and Experience

**User Story:** As a user (patient), I want an intuitive web interface that makes it easy to manage medical records and permissions, so that I can efficiently perform my tasks without technical complexity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the system THEN the system SHALL provide role-appropriate dashboard interfaces
2. WHEN performing actions THEN the system SHALL provide clear feedback and confirmation dialogs
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages with guidance
4. IF wallet connection is required THEN the system SHALL guide users through the connection process
5. WHEN using mobile devices THEN the system SHALL provide responsive design and functionality

### Requirement 7: Audit Trail and Compliance

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want comprehensive audit trails of all data access and permission changes, so that the system meets regulatory requirements and provides accountability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any access occurs THEN the system SHALL record timestamp, user, and accessed documents
2. WHEN permissions change THEN the system SHALL log the change with before/after states
3. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive audit logs
4. IF regulatory inquiry occurs THEN the system SHALL provide verifiable access history
5. WHEN data is accessed THEN the system SHALL maintain immutable records on the blockchain
